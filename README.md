## Can I customize the invoice template ?
Of course ; it's in `src/assets/invoice-template.html`. 

It uses [Mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/) under the hood, so variables are into two pairs of curly braces. 

If you want to add/remove fields to/from the invoice template, think about add/remove invoice data in `src/invoice/prepare-invoice-data.ts`.

There is also a few "hard coded" data, such as the invoice line, which you can modify in `src/invoice/prepare-invoice-data.ts`.
